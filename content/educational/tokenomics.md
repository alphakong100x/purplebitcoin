# PBTC Tokenomics: Deflationary by Design

Purple Bitcoin ($PBTC) features a carefully designed tokenomics model that combines the scarcity principles of Bitcoin with the speed and efficiency of Solana. This guide explains how PBTC's tokenomics work and why they create sustainable value.

## Supply Mechanism

PBTC launched with a total supply of **10,000,000,000** (10 billion) tokens. Unlike many cryptocurrencies, PBTC is deflationary by design, meaning the total supply continuously decreases over time.


- **Capped Maximum Supply**: Like Bitcoin, PBTC has a hard cap â€” no more tokens can ever be created beyond the initial supply.
- **Burn Mechanism**: A portion of every PBTC transaction is automatically burned (permanently removed from circulation).
- **No Minting Function**: The smart contract does not allow new tokens to be created.

## The Burn Mechanism Explained

The heart of PBTC's deflationary model is its burn mechanism:

1. **Transaction Fee Burning**: 2% of each transaction's value is automatically burned.
2. **Travel Platform Burning**: 0.5% of each booking made on the Purple Travel Platform using PBTC is burned.
3. **Community Wallet Burns**: Strategic token burns from the community wallet occur during significant milestones.


| Time Period | Est. Total Burned | Supply Reduction |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| First Month | 50 million        | 0.5%             |
| First Year  | 600 million       | 6%               |
| Five Years  | 3 billion+        | 30%+             |

*Note: Actual burn rates may vary based on transaction volume and usage.*

## Economic Benefits of Deflationary Model

PBTC's deflationary mechanism creates several economic advantages:

- **Increasing Scarcity**: As tokens are burned, the total supply decreases, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens.
- **Incentivized Holding**: The deflationary nature encourages longer-term holding rather than frequent trading.
- **Sustainable Price Support**: Regular burns create ongoing upward pressure on token value.
- **Natural Demand Growth**: As utility increases and supply decreases, the demand-supply dynamics favor price appreciation.

## Comparison to Other Models

| Feature               | PBTC               | Bitcoin           | Standard Tokens       |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Max Supply            | 10B (decreasing)   | 21M (fixed)       | Often unlimited       |
| Deflationary          | Yes, auto-burn     | Yes, halving      | Usually no            |
| Transaction Speed     | Fast (Solana)      | Slow (BTC)        | Varies                |
| Transaction Cost      | Very Low           | High              | Varies                |
| Supply Curve          | Decreasing         | Slowing increase  | Typically increasing  |

## Utility Integration

What makes PBTC's tokenomics particularly powerful is the integration with real-world utility:

- **Purple Travel Platform**: Using PBTC for travel bookings provides discounts while also burning tokens.
- **Purple Pay (Coming Soon)**: Payment system will integrate the same burn mechanism.
- **DeFi Opportunities**: Staking and liquidity programs (planned) will work alongside the deflationary model.

## Tracking Burns and Supply

You can track PBTC burns and circulating supply in real-time:

1. Through the Autonomous Asset dashboard (on this site)
2. Via Solana explorers that track the PBTC burn address
3. Through regular burn reports published in our community channels

## Conclusion

PBTC's deflationary tokenomics create a powerful economic model where:

- Real utility drives transaction volume
- Transaction volume increases burn rate
- Burning decreases supply
- Decreasing supply (with consistent demand) supports price growth
- Price growth attracts more users
- More users increase utility usage

This creates a sustainable cycle of value creation that benefits long-term holders and active users alike.
