# Purple Travel Platform: Using PBTC for Discounted Travel

The Purple Travel Platform represents one of the core utility features of Purple Bitcoin ($PBTC), allowing you to book flights, hotels, car rentals, and travel experiences worldwide while enjoying substantial discounts and earning rewards. This guide explains how to use the platform and maximize your benefits as a PBTC holder.

Traditional travel booking platforms charge substantial fees and markups. Purple Travel disrupts this model by:

- **Eliminating intermediary fees** through blockchain technology

## Understanding Discounts and Rewards


Purple Travel offers tiered discounts based on the payment method and your PBTC holdings:

| Payment Method | Base Discount | Silver Tier | Gold Tier | Purple Tier |
|----------------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| PBTC           | 10%          | 12%        | 15%       | 18%         |
| Other Crypto   | 5%           | 6%         | 8%        | 10%         |
| Credit Card    | 2%           | 3%         | 4%        | 5%          |

*Tier requirements: Silver (10,000+ PBTC), Gold (100,000+ PBTC), Purple (1,000,000+ PBTC)*


Every booking earns PBTC rewards:

- **Flight Bookings**: 2% of booking value returned as PBTC
- **Hotel Bookings**: 3% of booking value returned as PBTC
- **Packages**: 3.5% of booking value returned as PBTC
- **Special Promotions**: Occasional 2x or 3x reward multipliers for certain destinations


Every Purple Travel booking contributes to PBTC's deflationary mechanism:

- 0.5% of each booking value in PBTC is permanently burned
- These burns are recorded on-chain and viewable in the transaction history
- The platform displays total PBTC burned through travel bookings

## Tips for Maximizing Value

1. **Hold PBTC for Tier Benefits**: Maintaining a higher tier significantly increases your discounts
2. **Book Packages**: Combined bookings offer the highest discount percentages
3. **Watch for Promotions**: The platform regularly offers special deals on specific destinations
4. **Book in Advance**: Earlier bookings often qualify for additional discounts
5. **Refer Friends**: Earn 50 PBTC for each new user who completes a booking
